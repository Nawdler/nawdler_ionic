##Nawdler

Nawdler is an app designed to help busy people understand their routines.

###Use
Users can input steps of their routine and time any of them in any order. The user can hit "I'm Probably Done" to pause and stop, and "Finish and Analyze" to complete their routine and view a graph comparing each time they've completed that routine. When a user clicks on a bar in the graph, they can view a donut chart representing the breakdown of tasks in that routine attempt.

###Use Cases
1.)  Carlos likes to bike to class some days, and take Muni other days. Carlos can input the steps of each of those (pack up bike, bike, lock bike, walk to the bus stop, wait for the bus, ride the bus, walk from the bus to school), and each day he can time the ones he does that day.

2.)  Anita is currently applying to jobs, which is an unstructured task that takes most of the day every day. Anita's parents might be curious about Anita's job application progress, so Anita can enter and time her job-search tasks into Nawdler to track them. Anita can then view the breakdown of working on her resume, writing cover letters, researching, and interviewing, and even put that in with other daily tasks such as having meals and exercising and leasure time so that her parents don't think she's a slacker.

3.)  Aiko and her partner have two young kids that take forever to get out the door in the morning and get to bed at night. Aiko and her partner use Nawdler to create a rewards system for the kids for completing their tasks quickly and without dawdling. The kids can now race against themselves, gamifying a simple routine.
